## Descrption
- The GitHub repository provides a comprehensive exploration of two main sections: "Literature" and "Data." In the "Literature" section, it delves into the background, research question, methodology, and results of two parts. Part I focuses on general research aspects, while Part II specifically addresses the application of machine learning in predicting gold price changes based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The "Data" section includes a data dictionary and a flowchart detailing the data structure. Additionally, the repository offers insights into the code with flowcharts and pseudo-code. The overarching research question is, "Can machine learning methods effectively predict gold price changes based on CPI."
